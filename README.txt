running shmup will prompt you to install all dependencies
install_dependencies.py runs the exact same process
or you can manually install each package in requirements.txt

live_tracker.py is to set up the camera
  it does not affect the game in any way
  check the background for conflicting colors
  figure out where to stand
  etc.

conf.json controls a few game settings. 
feel free to tweak them
